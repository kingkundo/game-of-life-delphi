# Conway's Game of Life -- in Delphi!
A recreation of the classic Conway's Game Of Life written in Object Pascal with the Delphi VCL.

The code was written in (and targets) Delphi XE's RAD Studio Rio and should work with out of the box, though compatibility should run all the way down past Delphi 7. Minor changes to the project source might be required, however.
